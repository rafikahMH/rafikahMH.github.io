<p>What started off as a school project that I did with a few of my developer friends while we were on our internships in San Francsico turned out to be something that got us $10,000 in funding.</p>

<p>After four failed attempts in getting our business ideas up and running, we were trying very hard to find an idea that would be beneficial to many and yet is able to spin the money-maker.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from my internship company based in San Francisco, <a href="stellarloyalty.com">Stellar Loyalty</a>, the idea for this project is simple: to reward anyone each time they purchase from their favourite brands.</p>

<br><br>

<p>I led the product design and feature development of the mobile app. The motivation behind the way it is being built is based on three problems many users face with existing loyalty programs: too many loyalty cards, too slow to earn points and unappealing rewards. We aimed to solve these issues with the following features</p>

<h3 id="home">Home</h3>

<h5 id="link-your-debit-or-credit-cards-spend-as-per-usual-and-earn-points-automatically">Link your debit or credit cards, spend as per usual and earn points automatically.</h5>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/max-home.png#center" alt="Image" />
<br>
The home screen aimed to push out the most relevant information for users: what you&rsquo;ve earned, rewards that you can redeem as well as recommended offers that you are most likely to click on based on past browsing history on the app.</p>

<h3 id="offers">Offers</h3>

<h5 id="earn-points-by-spending-at-your-favourite-brands">Earn points by spending at your favourite brands.</h5>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/max-offers.png#centertwo" alt="Image" />
<img src="/images/max-offers-details.png#centertwo" alt="Image" />
<br>
Offers give you a quick snapshot of which offers you have already activated and your progress at earning each of them. To get them to keep using the app, a list of recommended offers is also provided for them to browse and explore.</p>

<p>Once you click on an Offer page, you can view more details about the retailer providing it, as well as the offer itself.</p>

<h3 id="rewards">Rewards</h3>

<h5 id="redeem-curated-rewards-according-to-your-spending-data">Redeem curated rewards according to your spending data.</h5>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/max-rewards.png#centertwo" alt="Image" />
<img src="/images/max-rewards-details.png#centertwo" alt="Image" />
<br>
<br>
<br>
To give users the power to filter out rewards according to the brand they love, I created a visual representation of the brands that they are most likely to patron according to spending data.</p>

<p>Once you click on a Rewards page, you can view more details about the retailer providing it, as well as how to earn the reward itself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Besides all the design work, I also had to strategize on how the points earning rule and infrastructure would work. This had countless internal debates between the team due to how important the infrastructure would be to the overall revenue.</p>

<p><img src="/images/max-points.png#center" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>We came up with two types of offers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing Offers</strong>: Earn X number of points for every $Y spent perpetually</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Offers</strong>: Earn bonus X points for a lump-sum $Y spent</li>
</ul>

<p>And, two tiers in terms of the retailers on the Max platform:
* <strong>High Tier</strong>: Consumers earn 2 points for every $1 spent
* <strong>Low Tier</strong>: Consumers earn 1 points for every $1 spent</p>

<p>Note: The tiers are based on the assumption of purchase basket size for each user per month.</p>

<hr />

<p>As we&rsquo;ve gone through user feedback and experimentation, my vision for this project has morphed yet again. In delivering for the consumer&rsquo;s needs, it is important to understand the retailers&rsquo; concerns as well. Cracking this has been fun, and what follows is more validation.</p>
