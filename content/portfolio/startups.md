Being involved as the President of the [NUS Entrepreneurship Society](https://www.nes.org.sg/) in 2016, I was very much engaged within the start-up scene in Singapore, and still is. 

The highlights of the year included:

### Inaugural Internship Fair

We successfully liaised with over 20 corporate partners such as Uber, e27 and many other start-ups to hold the inaugural internship fair. The event saw over 300 budding entrepreneurs and start-up enthusiasts from all over Singapore (top three universities: NUS, NTU and SMU) who came down to NUS campus to seek internship opportunities from exciting start-ups. Truly an amazing networking haven!

### Nation-wide Student Engagement

As part of the student engagement pipeline, we called down many founders from start-ups all over Singapore such as [TribeHired](https://tribehired.com/splash/user), [Happy Marketer](https://www.happymarketer.com/), and [VersaFleet](https://versafleet.co/) to speak and share with aspiring student entrepreneurs. Events included: industry awareness series, workshops and bootcamps.

### Entrepreneurial Blog
