When I first came to San Francisco, I was itching to work on viable business ideas and build (or break) things.

A self-taught web developer, a Computer Science student and Swift developer, as well as myself got together to work on something that one of my team mates have been working on for a few months. 

It's a simple problem: finding the right co-founders is often akin to finding needles in a haystack. The process of blind networking is inefficient and repetitive. Most networking tools do not take into account human elements such as personality fit.

How Zygod aims to resolve this problem is by providing an intelligent matching web platform that allows you to find the right co-founders to build your start-up with, by simplifying and humanising the process of networking. 

The process is straightforward.

The recommendations that appear on the carousel would capture not only the people with the role that I am looking for but also take into account the personalities and interests that I want, based on the information that I've keyed in on the Dream Team section. The matches would appear based on percentage of fit from highest on the left to lowest on the right. This speeds up the process of initial screening with the ability to narrow down to 1 candidate based on requirements.

Once narrowed down, you can click on the person to go to the profile page. This is different from other networking sites - it is engaging with a 30-seconds video where the person can speak about his beliefs, the problems he is keen to solve, and his passions. You can also schedule to attend networking events together, as well as chat online.

Some of the user feedback received is the scalability of such an application since there is bound to be a chicken-and-egg problem.
