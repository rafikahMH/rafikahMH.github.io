What started off as a school project that I did with a few of my developer friends while we were on our internships in San Francsico turned out to be something that got us $10,000 in funding. 

After four failed attempts in getting our business ideas up and running, we were trying very hard to find an idea that would be beneficial to many and yet spins the money-maker. The idea for this project is simple: to reward anyone each time they purchase from their favourite brands.
