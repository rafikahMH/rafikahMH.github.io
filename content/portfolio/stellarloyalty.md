I spent a year at [Stellar Loyalty](https://stellarloyalty.com/), an enterprise marketing SaaS start-up that provides brands with modern, cloud software that can engage and build loyalty with their customers.

I do a range of things from back-end feature development to product designs of mobile and web applications. But, let's talk about mobile for now. 

After hearing a range of feedback from clients and sales team alike, this project started out as a personal learning side-gig. I first identified the problems I collated from various sources. 

The direct users, who are the **marketers**, face two problems:     

* Only one style to configure with, which reduces flexibility to engage customers
* A lot of manual actions on the marketers’ end to get the image to look right within each app placement 

The indirect users, who are the brand's **customers**, face the following problem: 

* Mobile app looks very old and different from the current apps, which throws off the users and prevent continued usage

So let's break this down into three actionable steps.

### Improving Style Configurability
To introduce flexibility into the white-label application, I added two new homepage styles: **Action Style** and **Vertical Carousel Style**. With new styles, it allows marketers to add or remove more crucial information and action types.

#### Action Style
Similar to Facebook, such a homepage style shows only the most crucial information for users to take action, be it to submit a photo, post a caption or take part in an offer.

#### Vertical Carousel Style
Similar to Starbucks, such a homepage style focuses on content driving user exploration and continued usage.

### Decreasing Manual Actions for Marketers to Upload Content

**PROBLEM #1**: Marketers upload a single image on the Stellar marketer console and the different placement settings would adjust the image size accordingly, but this would result in bad images<br>
**CHANGE #1**: Expand the image size from square to rectangle which fits most images

**PROBLEM #2**: Too much text on the screen<br>  	
**CHANGE #2**: Remove body text and add a clickable action for users to click on in order to read more

### Sleek, Modern Interface

The re-design adapted very closely to iOS design guidelines in terms of fonts and layout. I also added minor transitions between pages to create the light feel.

### Sprint Planning
After working on the re-designs casually, we discussed as a team over lunch and decided it's high time to invest in better UX design. This is where the product sprints came about where I had many meetings with the mobile development team sitting in Manila (with 16 hours difference). 

I am glad to be a part of such an agile product and development team, especially when we managed to come out with a working prototype of this mobile app design revamp in two weeks - just in time for an important sales pitch that scored us a big client.
