Attended my third hackathon in a row that month with low spirits and high caffeine levels, but lo-and-behold, my team and I managed to clinch the top 5 teams out of over 300 at the API World Hackathon 2016 in San Francisco.

Kingfashion is a white-label, augmented reality mobile app that gamifies the shopping experience for online consumers.

This idea came about when we realized how mundane and impersonal the current online shopping experience is. KingFashion lets users go through an immersive experience of browsing and trying on clothes just by using the smartphone. We give users recommendations based on their personality, previous purchases and preferences, in order to provide a better match.

### Features
* Smart and targeted recommendations personalised to each indivdual 
* Swipeable UX where the more consumers swipe, the more we are able to recommend an accurate product to them, including other easy-to-use swiping functionality 
* Allows users to scroll through different products of different body parts (i.e.: headgear, tops, pants, shoes) on one screen depending on consumer profile and purchase history

### Technologies Used
API World Hackathon 2016 had a range of companies providing their APIs to create useful applications, and my team used the following APIs:

* **[Traitify](https://www.traitify.com/api/)** — understanding human personalities and recommending products accordingly through both the swiping of products as well as the other recommendations section
* **[Yaas](https://devportal.yaas.io/)** — provide initial recommendations based on personal purchase history to tailor-made the first few predictions
* **[HPE](https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis)** — provide smarter recommendations the more a consumer swipes through machine learning

One of the most exhilarating 24 hours with the best bunch trying to figure out augmented reality and machine learning.
