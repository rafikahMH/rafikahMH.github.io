I recently started a 6-months internship in the growth marketing team, specifically managing social advertising spend for Uber's APACx operations.

As I am writing this in February 2017, it is still early days to share a specific project but all I can say is that my learning curve has been tremendous.

Being someone who is growth hacking enthusiast (shout out to [Josh Fetcher](https://joshfechter.com/) - check out his [latest](https://www.producthunt.com/r/e8f19702d51595) growth hack bible), I love the ability to strategize and execute on these hacks on such a large scale at Uber.

Some of the tools and platforms I've been using daily include:

* **Smartly**: A Facebook campaign optimization tool that allows me to conduct predictive budget allocation across ad-sets and/or campaigns
* **Facebook Ads Manager**: Setting up of Facebook campaigns and tracking of performance through Analytics or Brand Lift studies
* **Twitter/Snapchat Ads Manager**: Setting up of Twitter/Snapchat campaigns and tracking of performance through platform dashboards
* **Google Data Studio**: Creation of dashboards for yearly reviews and daily monitoring 
* **SQL/Hive**: Internal analytics tools to monitor experiment and campaign performance
* **Incrementality and A/B Testing**: Strategizing on which levers to pull in order to improve acquisition performance

Very excited to be part of the team - more updates to come!
