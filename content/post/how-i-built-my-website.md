Having never build a website from scratch, this has been a truly challenging yet rewarding experience from me. I told myself not to go the WordPress or Squarespace paid theme route to push my front-end web development skills, and woah, it's definitely paid off.

What I built this site on: 

* Hugo 
* Building upon [Initio's](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-initio/) theme
* HTML5
* Bootstrap CSS3
* Jquery
* Markdown
* Open Sans typeface
* Netlify

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an extremely fast static site generator. Do check them out, though I would advise to read the documentation before trying because it is built on the Go language.
